# Levels Beyond Angular Issues Page

This is a Single Page Application using AngularJS (and other libraries) that uses the 
Github API to pull issues from the Angular Repository for the last 7 days. 

Each page displays 30 issues, the next or previous 30 issues can be reached by using the next and previous buttons. 
Each page can be additionally filtered down using the search bar. 

The title, author, author photo, assignee, body, and issue number is displayed with each issue.

A demo of the app can be found [here](http://natethompson.me/lb-frontend/).

Additionally you can demo the application by cloning the repository and opening index.html in your favorite (modern) web browser.
